# Caesar Cipher

### Check out this working example: [Caesar Cipher Demo](https://jpbruehw.github.io/caesar-cipher/)

A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on. The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. Here is what Caesar Cipher with a shift of three would look like:
